              <h3>Definition of brand development:</h3>
              <p>Brand development is strategically managing and growing a brand over time. The goal is to build lasting brand equity, spread awareness, connect emotionally with target customers, and stand out.</p>
              <p>Unlike branding, which deals with logos and visuals, brand development looks at the bigger picture of positioning a brand to drive business growth.It’s an ongoing process of understanding customers, defining the brand identity and promise, communicating it effectively, and adapting it when needed.</p>

              <h3>Definition of brand development:</h3>
              <p>Investing time and resources into thoughtful brand development matters for a few key reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Increases awareness and recognition</li>
                <li>Supports business growth objectives</li>
                <li>Attracts and retains more customers</li>
                <li>Builds brand equity and value</li>
                <li>Differentiates from competitors</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-40">Without intentional brand development, brands lack strategic direction. Their messages may need to be clarified for buyers or fully resonate. Brand development brings meaningful clarity and growth.</p>

              <h3>Types of brand development strategies:</h3>
              <p>There are four main strategies companies use to build and grow brands:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Line extension: <span>A line extension is when a company introduces a new offering within an existing product category under a current brand name. </span></li>
                <li>Brand extension: <span>It is when a company uses an established brand name to launch new products in a different product category. For example, Amazon initially moved from selling only books to now selling electronics, cloud services, and grocery delivery.</span></li>
                <li>Multi-brands: <span>A multi-brand strategy is when a company manages and markets several brands in the same product category. Each brand targets a distinct consumer segment even though the brands may compete for market share.</span> </li>
                <li>New brands: <span>Companies launch entirely new brands when they believe a new brand will resonate better with potential new customers than extending an existing brand into a segment, category.</span></li>
              </ul>
